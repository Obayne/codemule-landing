\# 1. Brand Overview



Codemule’s visual and verbal identity is built around three pillars:



\### ⭐ Clarity  

Clean lines, simple shapes, minimal noise.  

The brand should always help reduce cognitive load.



\### ⭐ Precision  

Angular design, intentional choices, structured visual logic.



\### ⭐ Approachability  

Codemule must feel trustworthy, friendly, and helpful — not corporate or cold.



The brand should support both beginners (simplicity) and experts (structure).

\# 2. Core Brand Identity



Codemule’s identity reflects:



\- AI-assisted development  

\- Simplicity in complexity  

\- “Mule” as a symbol of reliability, work ethic, and persistence  

\- Code lines representing structure and logic  

\- Angular geometry representing clarity and sharp thinking  



The overall tone is:



\- clean  

\- sharp  

\- technical  

\- organized  

\- modern  



Without being sterile or intimidating.

\# 3. Logo System



Codemule’s logo is based on:



\- a stylized mule head  

\- angular, geometric lines  

\- subtle “code line” texture  

\- clean silhouette that works at small sizes  



There are \*\*three required variants\*\*:



\### 3.1 Primary Logo (Horizontal)

\- Mule icon on the left  

\- “codemule” text on the right  

\- Used in headers, marketing materials, thumbnails



\### 3.2 Icon-Only Logo

\- Mule silhouette alone  

\- Used in navigation bars, favicons, buttons, app icons



\### 3.3 Inline Monotone Variant

\- Single-color version for small or high-contrast environments  

\- Used on dark or solid backgrounds  

\- Required for merch and print

\# 4. Logo Usage Rules



\### ✔ Correct usage:

\- Maintain clear space around the logo  

\- Use approved colors only  

\- Ensure strong contrast  

\- Scale proportionally  

\- Keep lines crisp (icons should be SVG where possible)



\### ✘ Incorrect usage:

\- Do not stretch or distort  

\- Do not rotate  

\- Do not add shadows or effects  

\- Do not place on noisy backgrounds  

\- Do not alter the mule shape  

\- Do not recolor arbitrarily  



Consistency = trust.

\# 5. Color Palette



Codemule uses a \*\*minimal, intentional palette\*\* designed for clarity and contrast.



\### Primary Colors:

| Role | Color | Hex |

|------|-------|------|

| Brand Highlight | Electric Yellow | `#facc15` |

| Background | Deep Navy | `#0f1629` |

| Text (primary) | White | `#ffffff` |



\### Secondary / Optional:

| Role | Color | Hex |

|------|-------|------|

| Muted Grey | UI Subtle | `#bbbbbb` |

| Soft Border | Divider | `#1f2937` |



\### How to use:

\- Electric Yellow: sparingly for emphasis (CTA buttons, icons, accents)  

\- Deep Navy: default background  

\- White: main text  

\- Grey: secondary text, dividers  



The palette must NEVER feel cluttered or childish.

\# 7. Tone \& Messaging



Codemule speaks like a:



\- clear mentor  

\- patient senior developer  

\- structured guide  

\- no-hype, no-nonsense engineer  



\### Tone attributes:

\- direct  

\- calm  

\- confident  

\- helpful  

\- honest  



\### Avoid:

\- technical arrogance  

\- overly casual tone  

\- marketing buzzwords  

\- vague promises  



Codemule is grounded and trustworthy.

\# 8. Buttons, CTAs, and UI Voice



Codemule uses intentional, clear call-to-action language:



\### Examples:

\- “Get Started”  

\- “Join Waitlist”  

\- “Build With Codemule”  

\- “Generate Project”  

\- “Fix This Error”  



\### Avoid:

\- vague phrases like “Learn More,” “Click Here,” “Discover”  

\- hype like “Revolutionize Your Coding!”  



Clarity always wins.

\# 9. Imagery \& Iconography



Codemule prefers:



\### ✔ Geometric shapes  

\### ✔ Line-based illustrations  

\### ✔ Minimal icon sets  

\### ✔ Code-inspired visual patterns  



And avoids:



\### ✘ Photos of people  

\### ✘ Random stock images  

\### ✘ Overly busy or colorful graphics  



The visual language should support calm focus.

\# 10. Layout \& Spacing



Codemule’s design must feel \*\*open and breathable\*\*.



Rules:

\- Use wide margins  

\- Give elements room  

\- Prioritize readability  

\- Avoid cramped layouts  

\- Use consistent grid spacing (8px system recommended)



This reduces cognitive overwhelm.

\# 11. Brand Assets Folder Structure



All brand files should live under:



```

/assets/brand/

&nbsp;   logo-primary.svg

&nbsp;   logo-primary.png

&nbsp;   logo-icon.svg

&nbsp;   logo-icon.png

&nbsp;   favicon-16.png

&nbsp;   favicon-32.png

&nbsp;   favicon-64.png

&nbsp;   favicon-128.png

```



The SVG versions are considered canonical.

\# 12. Future Brand Extensions



Codemule may eventually include:



\- “MuleTeam” agent icons (Architect Mule, Code Mule, etc.)  

\- Progress indicators shaped like plows  

\- Merchandise (caps, stickers, shirts)  

\- Motion graphics for loading screens  



These will follow the same angular, minimal aesthetic.
