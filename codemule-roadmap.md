# 1. Roadmap Overview

Codemule’s roadmap is built in clear, intentional phases.  
Each phase focuses on stability, clarity, and real user value — not speed for its own sake.

The roadmap is designed to:

- Prevent overwhelm  
- Keep development aligned  
- Ensure visible progress  
- Maintain a clean, scalable product  
- Provide a clear sequence of next steps

- Create trust through clarity and branding  
- Provide the first working version of the assistant  
- Build the documentation foundation  

## Deliverables:
- Landing page  
- Waitlist form with redirect

(Branding integration and assistant page still in progress)

# PHASE 2 — **Useful Developer Tooling**  
# -----------------------------------------

Codemule becomes not just a website —  
but a tool developers can actually *use*.

## Goals:
- Provide real coding utility  
- Improve context handling  
- Add structured workflows  
- Increase reliability  
- Introduce early multi-agent behaviors (lite mode)

## Features:
- Project templates (web app, API, CLI)  
- “Generate File” workflows  
- Simple project explorer UI  
- Session-level context memory  
- Error fixing + debugging flows  
- Better next-step guidance  
- Stable formatting consistency  
- Improved assistant ergonomics  

## Success Criteria:
- A user can build a small working project with Codemule  
- A user understands what is happening at all times  
- No overwhelm, no chaos

# -----------------------------------------
# PHASE 3 — **MuleTeam Multi-Agent System**  
# -----------------------------------------

## Goal:
Turn Codemule into a **team of cooperative AI developers**, not a single assistant.

## Mule Roles:
- **Architect Mule** — plans structure  
- **Code Mule** — writes implementation  
- **Debug Mule** — isolates and fixes issues  
- **Reviewer Mule** — provides critique + improvements  
- **Document Mule** — generates docs, READMEs  
- **Builder Mule** — handles packaging, deployment scripts  

## Features:
- Agent-to-agent communication  
- Progress visualization (plows as progress bars)  
- Automatic PR generation  
- Whole-project refactoring support  
- Multi-file reasoning  
- Auto-lint + typing tools  

## Success Criteria:
- Codemule can build and maintain multi-file projects  
- Tasks can be delegated across roles  
- User sees clear progress state

# -----------------------------------------
# PHASE 4 — **Full AI Development Environment**  
# (Optional Future Expansion)
# -----------------------------------------

Codemule becomes a complete workspace.

## Enhancements:
- Persistent cloud projects  
- User accounts + settings  
- Live shared sessions  
- Team collaboration mode  
- Realtime preview   
- Local + cloud model selection  
- Desktop version of Codemule

# 3. Prioritized Task List (Actionable)

## Completed:
- Domain purchased  
- Repo initialized  
- Vercel deployment  
- Header + landing structure  
- Waitlist form (working)  
- Initial branding  
- `codemule-spec.md`  
- `codemule-brand-guide.md`  

---

## Current Tasks (Next Actions):
1. Integrate final logo assets into `/assets/brand/`  
2. Update site header with real logo  
3. Add About page content  
4. Add FAQ content  
5. Style the waitlist form  
6. Build `assistant.html` basic UI  
7. Add footer + layout consistency  
8. Clean repo and remove placeholders  

---

## Upcoming Tasks:
- Add early task breakdown logic  
- Add example project templates  
- Add code editor container (optional Phase 2.5)  
- Implement basic multi-agent “handoff” system  
- Add app icons + favicon set  

---

# 4. Indicators of Progress

Codemule is on track when:

- Pages load fast  
- Branding is consistent  
- The assistant gives clear 1-step guidance  
- The user never feels overwhelmed  
- Documentation keeps pace with development  
- Small features ship regularly  

---

# 5. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Overbuilding early  
**Mitigation:** Stay within Phase 1 scope before adding complexity.

### Risk: User overwhelm  
**Mitigation:** Maintain clarity-first rules in assistant behavior.

### Risk: Feature drift  
**Mitigation:** Roadmap signoff before major changes.

### Risk: Burnout / cognitive overload  
**Mitigation:** Single-step tasks, strong structure, visible progress.

# 6. Long-Term North Star

Codemule becomes:

- A stable workspace  
- A predictable assistant  
- A multi-agent development team  
- A clarity-first coding environment  
- A trustworthy partner for both beginners and experts  

Codemule is NOT hype.  
It is practical, structured, understandable AI for real people.
